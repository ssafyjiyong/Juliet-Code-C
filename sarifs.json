The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing with exploiting input the test case spawns two threads, the first thread (thread A) starts by pausing its execution while the second thread (thread B) locks the second mutex lock. Thread B then pauses its execution and allows thread A to lock the first mutex lock and try to lock the second mutex lock. Thread A will now hang on the call to lock the second mutex lock since thread B holds it, thread B will then try to grab the first mutex lock, but since thread A holds it the system will enter deadlock. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: UNION\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_ALIAS_1\n - Control Flow: SET_JUMP_LONG_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150216-v1.0.0/C-C833A-SUBV-09-ST04-DT07-DF01-CF23-01.xml"},"length":94125,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"e252b0df77279007114a0265be9cbb40f7734c3a031d6d27274dcbf6e0ddbfb2"}},{"location":{"uri":"150216-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150216-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c"},"length":50597,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"3af51ca0a812d936d4d07ddf9e3bce3fd4657b1c15bb58a8310fdc387e5f675e"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"833","name":"Deadlock"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-833","message":{"text":"Deadlock."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150216-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":240,"endLine":243}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"833","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151721-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151721/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151721-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151721,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BASIC\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151721-v1.0.0/C-C773A-SUBV-10-ST02-DT04-DF11-CF18-01.xml"},"length":142771,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"a0bb2d66ac7d1eb5b00fc38699f3e5c3b042c321a43549e36063c452270bb012"}},{"location":{"uri":"151721-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":15541,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"6c262126f3703a8aa3a6137a1ee7f880dc73dbc155888920446835b70b0bf801"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"773","name":"Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-773","message":{"text":"Missing Reference to Active File Descriptor or Handle."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151721-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":420,"endLine":434}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"773","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149916-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149916/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149916-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149916,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source, and converts it to an integer, then an unsigned int.

If the test case is currently executing the non-reentrant function when the signal handler is called, it will re-enter the function and deadlock on the call to lock the mutex.  \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_LINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"149967-v1.0.0/C-C479A-SUBV-10-ST01-DT03-DF13-CF18-01.xml"},"length":78167,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"db1fe13aee999d72577ffc8bd6c679560013791f4da5c760d6d565ba3c32904c"}},{"location":{"uri":"149967-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":17832,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"dde5a035381e54ced704e3098a886b09c1199f43e404b392a649cc3c9e2d6bc3"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"479","name":"Signal Handler Use of a Non-reentrant Function"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-479","message":{"text":"Signal Handler Use of a Non-reentrant Function."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"149967-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":156,"endLine":158}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"479","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151845-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151845/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151845-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151845,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_CONSTANT\n - Control Flow: SET_JUMP_LONG_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151845-v1.0.0/C-C674A-SUBV-07-ST04-DT05-DF05-CF23-01.xml"},"length":79044,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"75efab34e49c59e6010f74220042936276728f1573d78bf8eae35f41b9edf477"}},{"location":{"uri":"151845-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"151845-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":49259,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"061eba924f87487e214033815b6352f80685cbadcf556e6ab92c80aae0deae48"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"674","name":"Uncontrolled Recursion"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-674","message":{"text":"Uncontrolled Recursion."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151845-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":917}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"674","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151001-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151001/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151001-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151001,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This weakness reads a number and attempts to modify the two high bytes of it, if it is greater than 65535.

If it did not allocate memory, the buffer pointer is still NULL, and this causes a NULL pointer dereference.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_CONSTANT\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"149563-v1.0.0/C-C476G-SUBV-03-ST01-DT01-DF05-CF24-01.xml"},"length":60834,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"cf45642a9c012eab1f0339e5ad45ef2feb28425f2366d27179914527a571928a"}},{"location":{"uri":"149563-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":37348,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"0a34f5d1a8d996774b45b54db95a1a8b44d77d357a98b6ffd87a9749db484aac"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"476","name":"NULL Pointer Dereference"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-476","message":{"text":"NULL Pointer Dereference."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"149563-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":992,"endLine":995}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"476","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152470-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152470/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152470-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152470,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: CALLBACK","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152470-v1.0.0/C-C089A-SUBV-06-ST01-DT02-DF14-CF01-01.xml"},"length":69334,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"663a2c50c59962e2f85d0ef3d97c95a13309090e29631d61a47656fb774d9010"}},{"location":{"uri":"152470-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":26436,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"2ded38e7c6bfe9a58a6461d7a8e38e4dc5bb670e5ce3cd586b8f3d7ca68b343e"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"89","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-89","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152470-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":702,"endLine":734}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"89","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151310-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151310/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151310-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151310,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This weakness reads a number to be used as a loop counter.

The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case checks the input string for non-alpha characters, and if it contains non-alpha characters the test case increments the counting semaphore and spawns two threads that both use the semaphore as an access control mechanism surrounding a shared reference to the input string. Since the semaphore incorrectly indicates that there are two counts of the input string available, both threads now have the ability to access the shared string (actual concurrent access is controlled by the control files and integer) leading to a segfault. If the input string does not contain non-alpha characters, only one thread will spawn and the semaphore will be decremented and incremented appropriately, allowing the test case to run without error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_LINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150068-v1.0.0/C-C765B-SUBV-07-ST01-DT02-DF13-CF20-01.xml"},"length":80424,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"f9d0f640fb614de92e6682278478fb2bc92b802843942fb0841af0d99d2da8cc"}},{"location":{"uri":"150068-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":52039,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"fa4e16aa20bd8d7a88148d3d2e1b9a2105018d6d739b4bd2406a7dc93dd6862f"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150068-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":209,"endLine":210}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152217-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152217/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152217-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152217,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152217-v1.0.0/C-C089C-SUBV-01-ST01-DT02-DF14-CF24-01.xml"},"length":69615,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"3bde1342d9cad8317d7928b2b3dbdb02adfb9eb5462d4c3e51a13f7c8f48cc6f"}},{"location":{"uri":"152217-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":72166,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"b17f2591d502201b7c82dfc70560240d96a61eec58187d1fc5d0245a5203aed6"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"89","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-89","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152217-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":176,"endLine":181}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"89","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150904-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150904/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150904-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150904,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case takes an integer and mods it by four.

However, if the file already exists, the test case will continually poll the existence of the file, waiting to be able to 'grab' the lock by creating the file, resulting in a paused state for as long as the file exists. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150133-v1.0.0/C-C412A-SUBV-06-ST03-DT04-DF17-CF20-01.xml"},"length":72707,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"64b69f0de039e4da69e4b2f973ffd22f2b9ac782422586c6023a2b20ce341043"}},{"location":{"uri":"150133-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":23577,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"47eae31e222fed9956e39f2dee742fea76626b4392f94de332053d846cd3fa12"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"412","name":"Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-412","message":{"text":"Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150133-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":695,"endLine":700}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"412","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151355-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151355/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151355-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151355,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case converts a user string to a short, and then converts that short to an unsigned int.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: VAR_ARG_LIST\n - Control Flow: CALLBACK","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"149988-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-06-ST02-DT01-DF12-CF01-01.xml"},"length":86800,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"057318c16b77506603cce199ec0dcbbd746492432aa58321c6d67c12e90956cc"}},{"location":{"uri":"149988-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":36156,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"7b18f5c2b2f28b1580720e76ae39dd9d8b9f09877a3f89218705c0ec6102035f"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"149988-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":302,"endLine":307}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151093-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151093/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151093-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151093,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case takes an integer and checks for an upper limit.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_FUNCTION_RETURN_VALUE\n - Control Flow: MACROS","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150187-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-01-ST04-DT02-DF06-CF22-01.xml"},"length":99679,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"ddcad7f5f90aee31fb147bbaff9a35e7b76150bea9d3dd0754dcbb2539421683"}},{"location":{"uri":"150187-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150187-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":83136,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"216aec5c1683e91f772d3138b8de3dd98dd8a6e308aa5f75ff161ae649a3beb8"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150187-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":301,"endLine":306}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150330-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150330/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150330-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150330,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements a time of check time of use vulnerability that allows arbitrary link following.

The test case takes the name of a control file and an input string. The control file is used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case assigns a signal hander that access an internal array, printing it's data to the output string. The test case then iterates through the input string, copying each character into the internal array, initialized to a size of 51. If the input string is greater than 50 characters in length, the test case resizes the array, temporarily setting it to null. If the signal handler is invoked while the new array is set to null the signal handler will dereference the null pointer resulting in a segfault. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150306-v1.0.0/C-C828A-SUBV-01-ST03-DT03-DF14-CF24-01.xml"},"length":87602,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"09b0b5cacaa3050a59771ef5780e5a4ff1125a7e132abade1f328d71c5bebba6"}},{"location":{"uri":"150306-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":74726,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"fffcd9bdac79a80d82402eea07f0e185fdfc9c357d8075d1d06ebb732b758f14"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"828","name":"Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-828","message":{"text":"Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150306-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":163,"endLine":168}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"828","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152051-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152051/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152051-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152051,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_LINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152051-v1.0.0/C-C835A-SUBV-02-ST04-DT01-DF13-CF18-01.xml"},"length":75180,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"af15a5593b46166233ef8853c9aadaefe3c403513ca7cb5e9967816fc1b037c1"}},{"location":{"uri":"152051-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"152051-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":7414,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"aedc443238786219ca48fdb5e53ebbde206b13fb4bef8401ea59cadc9c7505e7"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"835","name":"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-835","message":{"text":"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152051-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":180,"endLine":187}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"835","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149770-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149770/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149770-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149770,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source.

If it did not allocate memory, the buffer pointer is still NULL, and this causes a NULL pointer dereference.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: VAR_ARG_LIST\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"149762-v1.0.0/C-C476G-SUBV-03-ST02-DT06-DF12-CF03-01.xml"},"length":64350,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"de561d960bca414460cc39c692680f0558927838929cd4e7646eae004b45c294"}},{"location":{"uri":"149762-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":39182,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"2abc3cb3ef2037e26ec79de6284edc3f8fb08f733ea726c7c07482fdd19afe4c"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"476","name":"NULL Pointer Dereference"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-476","message":{"text":"NULL Pointer Dereference."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"149762-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1034,"endLine":1037}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"476","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152397-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152397/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152397-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152397,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_CONSTANT\n - Control Flow: CALLBACK","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152397-v1.0.0/C-C078B-SUBV-07-ST02-DT06-DF05-CF01-01.xml"},"length":64356,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"795245ba33d2c381961bfcc7d34847108cb945bdf8462bf38679569beee1022c"}},{"location":{"uri":"152397-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":51175,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"6da56f6ed781b0398745172cdaa249f1aae990147cee1fb7a107cca2e6dd37ca"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"78","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-78","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152397-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":967,"endLine":975}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"78","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150426-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150426/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150426-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150426,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements an asynchronous unsafe signal handler that access a string without properly null checking the pointer.

This will overwrite memory on the stack, resulting in segmentation fault upon return from the function.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_ARRAY_INDEX\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_10","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150961-v1.0.0/C-C191B-SUBV-09-ST03-DT06-DF16-CF14-01.xml"},"length":155889,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"7b82afc27173f4fc2ac1c004ac928cd5b3d18a241b709943e8287b113882c726"}},{"location":{"uri":"150961-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c"},"length":45933,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"f8bb72909528bc76ec711d75628b1e341b8d8ba30ce1b2a96daafd1b9aba71a5"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"191","name":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-191","message":{"text":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150961-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1226,"endLine":1230}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"191","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150292-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150292/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150292-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150292,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case takes the name of an externally accessible file as input, and treats the file as a global mutex lock.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: UNION\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_LINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150617-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-05-ST04-DT07-DF13-CF24-01.xml"},"length":100817,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"c4d992e3462003f7335787f40966192ab25438c237315c90c7c225ef47136c6c"}},{"location":{"uri":"150617-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150617-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c"},"length":50401,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"2e2c8f553d4fc9833f9510bb536d913792b1c0747d0594ed7b937258c0ecc266"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150617-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":290,"endLine":295}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151220-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151220/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151220-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151220,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case takes an unsigned long value and uses it in an initialization function for a struct.

When this pointer is later accessed, if the use after free has occurred, a segfault will occur due to the corrupted memory the pointer references. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153106-v1.0.0/C-C416A-SUBV-08-ST01-DT03-DF14-CF18-01.xml"},"length":63729,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"5761b1d3e1caba1afcf20628dd0a2298a947768cc099226b25e9f7123ac51fc4"}},{"location":{"uri":"153106-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c"},"length":38717,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"fd3d17a6aef28890255ec52fe18ff14e682d9be4c4379cdec5d43b369aa6d226"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"416","name":"Use After Free"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-416","message":{"text":"Use After Free."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153106-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1059,"endLine":1065}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"416","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150137-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150137/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150137-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150137,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements a singleton struct without synchronization that can lead to two threads receiving separate instances of the singleton struct resulting in a deadlocked state.

The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that it hits either a good or bad case, and the input integer is used as the number of integers to pass through the queue. The test case then spawns two threads, one to push the numbers 0 to the input integer to a queue, and one to read the values from the queue and print them to the output stream. The shared queue is implemented as a singleton and is a blocking queue, if both threads create a separate instance of the singleton they will block indefinitely causing a deadlock. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: MACROS","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150137-v1.0.0/C-C543A-SUBV-08-ST02-DT03-DF17-CF22-01.xml"},"length":76406,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"d7532e1b604ba969e947715d30824c942824576f1a17cfc18d4de6e4d3faeadf"}},{"location":{"uri":"150137-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c"},"length":43928,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"f8e8cc63d1d27ecda7d8ee38aa865d021cf58c0b616b38929479a317b952af46"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"543","name":"Use of Singleton Pattern Without Synchronization in a Multithreaded Context"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-543","message":{"text":"Use of Singleton Pattern Without Synchronization in a Multithreaded Context."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150137-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":275,"endLine":278}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"543","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151463-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151463/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151463-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151463,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: UNION\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151463-v1.0.0/C-C771A-SUBV-03-ST04-DT07-DF17-CF03-01.xml"},"length":133245,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"37937e9826ba9ddbf4767669f1b1716d32bdffb9b2dd107869bf27633803e45c"}},{"location":{"uri":"151463-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"151463-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":42565,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"0098ee4c3dc1d2ac370cf7c71457ba6dd09927248c5f490c41cf535650c57e8b"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"771","name":"Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-771","message":{"text":"Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151463-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":456}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"771","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/153165-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/153165/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"153165-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":153165,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements an unchecked write into a stack allocated buffer.

The weakness then accesses those pointers, resulting in a crash or execution of attacker-specified code. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: INDEX_ALIAS_2\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153470-v1.0.0/C-C120D-SUBV-02-ST01-DT05-DF08-CF18-01.xml"},"length":64288,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"30f74efdfa0bba55c4e7296ff1e605c2dfc5961e7572696dd57750b8dc50e5fa"}},{"location":{"uri":"153470-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":8056,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"03821ab63e8e1364872316c9a62efa12bc6cee8a3a53c2c914178061d9b40120"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"120","name":"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-120","message":{"text":"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153470-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":195,"endLine":197}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"120","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152147-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152147/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152147-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152147,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_FUNCTION_RETURN_VALUE\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152147-v1.0.0/C-C400A-SUBV-01-ST02-DT05-DF06-CF20-01.xml"},"length":62375,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"f9ff8c8d7a2219652c352879cb19ffd013bf09afc9016d94c951ecedde43820e"}},{"location":{"uri":"152147-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":72910,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"a935510edac98722cad03cf99784456ed788eace4464153e60f50a3202600303"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"400","name":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-400","message":{"text":"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152147-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":180,"endLine":205}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"400","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149605-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149605/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149605-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149605,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source.

The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case checks the input string for non-alpha characters, and if it contains non-alpha characters the test case increments the counting semaphore and spawns two threads that both use the semaphore as an access control mechanism surrounding a shared reference to the input string. Since the semaphore incorrectly indicates that there are two counts of the input string available, both threads now have the ability to access the shared string (actual concurrent access is controlled by the control files and integer) leading to a segfault. If the input string does not contain non-alpha characters, only one thread will spawn and the semaphore will be decremented and incremented appropriately, allowing the test case to run without error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_FUNCTION_RETURN_VALUE\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150695-v1.0.0/C-C765B-SUBV-09-ST03-DT06-DF06-CF18-01.xml"},"length":84216,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"73de598e043415dac8e93eb0591c6c6ee4003d25c76d3eefc0aafe06e7e8451e"}},{"location":{"uri":"150695-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c"},"length":48310,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"95f2fb89c2bb82c2eced3dc3386fc3fcca9b2184ee1d23f54af8434b186f54f0"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150695-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/cmdline.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":218,"endLine":219}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152608-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152608/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152608-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152608,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152608-v1.0.0/C-C089D-SUBV-10-ST01-DT04-DF14-CF20-01.xml"},"length":70269,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"ae7992804f837aa66b7703bf8ceb13fb9a40504aca81e5012d63e19e581d62c1"}},{"location":{"uri":"152608-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":15515,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"c154dd1dff29d3a28805aecfcb983187f89cb7777f0d22ea01bd8488a560aab9"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"89","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-89","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152608-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":297,"endLine":305}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"89","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149280-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149280/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149280-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149280,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source.

If it did not allocate memory, the buffer pointer is still NULL, and this causes a NULL pointer dereference.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_VARIABLE\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"149280-v1.0.0/C-C476G-SUBV-07-ST03-DT04-DF15-CF18-01.xml"},"length":65464,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"d13577c42d296d4d2e373598fddcc10da311d40a41228176e7d2c95e56616a5c"}},{"location":{"uri":"149280-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":48503,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"16c7ec6ec48a23f3f7a3a00e785d788ef462e66475154e7a59f5e55bb550faaa"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"476","name":"NULL Pointer Dereference"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-476","message":{"text":"NULL Pointer Dereference."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"149280-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":892,"endLine":895}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"476","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/153342-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/153342/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"153342-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":153342,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case creates a buffer on the stack of 1024 bytes and a struct on the stack containing a 64-byte buffer and a pointer to the beginning of that buffer. It copies the taint source into the 1024-char buffer. It checks if the length of the taint source is less than the length of the 64-byte buffer. If it is, it uses strncpy to copy the taint source into the 64-byte buffer, with a maximum value of 1024 bytes. However, strncpy always writes the maximum number of bytes, and so writes 1024 bytes. This overflows the other data in the struct, including the pointer that originally pointed to the beginning of the 64-byte buffer. The test case then calls strlen on that pointer in the struct.

If the divisor is calculated to be 0 and the second thread uses this value before it is san itized the test case segfault with a divide by zero error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BASIC\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150453-v1.0.0/C-C821A-SUBV-02-ST04-DT03-DF11-CF03-01.xml"},"length":98322,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"f14462ec5ab362f36f294f6075d01ef8772dc15f632770797eac954d987ff392"}},{"location":{"uri":"150453-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150453-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":13151,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"647f454b76cba7367480b8d19e6f6dee04b632101fc4bfb4e6d3dc91ef5d91ef"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"821","name":"Incorrect Synchronization"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-821","message":{"text":"Incorrect Synchronization."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150453-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":180,"endLine":184}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"821","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151107-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151107/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151107-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151107,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case converts a user string to a short, and then converts that short to an unsigned int.

The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case checks the input string for non-alpha characters, and if it contains non-alpha characters the test case increments the counting semaphore and spawns two threads that both use the semaphore as an access control mechanism surrounding a shared reference to the input string. Since the semaphore incorrectly indicates that there are two counts of the input string available, both threads now have the ability to access the shared string (actual concurrent access is controlled by the control files and integer) leading to a segfault. If the input string does not contain non-alpha characters, only one thread will spawn and the semaphore will be decremented and incremented appropriately, allowing the test case to run without error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_50","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150406-v1.0.0/C-C765B-SUBV-06-ST02-DT02-DF14-CF15-01.xml"},"length":83954,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"0c92ec20800a8986e9e31ee5ba7f6d24e4367732c928301bc50b673d2f7788e6"}},{"location":{"uri":"150406-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":37092,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"a1142d5511956b4bab055142e12f8275f74cbed63055925565835ca5d3ab4f1a"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150406-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":276,"endLine":277}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151131-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151131/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151131-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151131,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case squares a positive number.

Because the unsigned value is huge, this overwrites the stack, resulting in a segmentation fault upon return from the function. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BASIC\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_1","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150890-v1.0.0/C-C195A-SUBV-08-ST02-DT04-DF11-CF12-01.xml"},"length":70000,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"dab005e4b19c83b3677dbd429698c3a8038c7ca55ef2994280c1d8fdbd9ca338"}},{"location":{"uri":"150890-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c"},"length":37688,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"9404a47c15d272ee1b345d65cc5d00313c1e41575223082923f7032ca6c2fd7c"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"195","name":"Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-195","message":{"text":"Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150890-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1063,"endLine":1067}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"195","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151754-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151754/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151754-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151754,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: INDEX_ALIAS_2\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151754-v1.0.0/C-C789A-SUBV-06-ST04-DT05-DF08-CF20-01.xml"},"length":79843,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"3381309adb238effb0358db5055447558a0f491e2bb368b61bd927640c0fe05c"}},{"location":{"uri":"151754-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"151754-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":23477,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"24749cf6ffd48427c28862b7497acd6ed1dd7330edae3df432b60359fd21ba26"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"789","name":"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-789","message":{"text":"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151754-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":249,"endLine":252}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"789","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150432-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150432/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150432-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150432,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements two threads that lock a counting semaphore multiple times, causing a deadlock if the lock is locked more times that it is unlocked.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: VAR_ARG_LIST\n - Control Flow: RECURSIVE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150451-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-07-ST02-DT01-DF12-CF19-01.xml"},"length":86892,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"aa23414ad9f1d33a7f63ad6aa728fcd1b150aa21866d0acdca612af66341cd5c"}},{"location":{"uri":"150451-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":61999,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"584d78dc2912e03ac4763418a0bcb29de7a25cba4da5a35940f3494507381501"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150451-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":312,"endLine":317}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149768-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149768/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149768-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149768,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source, and converts it to an integer, then an unsigned int.

The control file is used as a method to delay execution long enough for this vulnerability to occur. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: MACROS","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150516-v1.0.0/C-C367A-SUBV-01-ST02-DT03-DF17-CF22-01.xml"},"length":88705,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"3c75eac51cabaf0bee4e390d09b1ebec90462b64ecadc7a4b3fd568cd16e9b2e"}},{"location":{"uri":"150516-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":75888,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"ec91e5e041a597f60f159a1d1d1f122c05e5239b97cc331de8d7f03f74418a3d"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"367","name":"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-367","message":{"text":"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150516-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":2198,"endLine":2209}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"367","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149498-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149498/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149498-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149498,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source, and converts it to an integer, then an unsigned int.

It expects to read 3 strings from a file in the format: double quote, up to 79 characters, double quote, comma; double quote, up to 79 characters, double quote, comma; and double quote, up to 79 characters, double quote. The test case then creates an array of 3 pointers, setting each pointer to NULL initially. It checks each string read from the file, and if the length of the string from the file is non-zero, it sets the corresponding pointer to that string.

Subsequently, the test case calls the function pointer from the struct, using the char* from the struct as an argument. If these values have not been initialized, this will result in a segmentation fault or illegal instruction fault. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BASIC\n - Control Flow: RECURSIVE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153581-v1.0.0/C-C824B-SUBV-07-ST01-DT03-DF11-CF19-01.xml"},"length":65610,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"851ce2bb7fe46c026021441e67a60eab4cd4a318a710df38e70ee17f8e703f23"}},{"location":{"uri":"153581-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":49131,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"d9731ba74c9b98b7a1851fd446ee5516cc22e729c8abf04cd9c19fb08b7a4293"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"824","name":"Access of Uninitialized Pointer"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-824","message":{"text":"Access of Uninitialized Pointer."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153581-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":900,"endLine":901}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"824","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/153736-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/153736/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"153736-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":153736,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements an incorrectly checked write into a buffer that is contained within a heap allocated struct.

If the input string does not contain non-alpha characters, only one thread will spawn and the semaphore will be decremented and incremented appropriately, allowing the test case to run without error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150177-v1.0.0/C-C765B-SUBV-03-ST03-DT02-DF17-CF03-01.xml"},"length":84908,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"0d07929641e59b4f11dd75cc7ebdaec20ab41e4bcdf6ef396fd22da55557170c"}},{"location":{"uri":"150177-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":42795,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"3c27b178523fcb0e04944e9f1f24e64e7319e6d1dd83aef2698795d1bfdb9cdb"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150177-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":233,"endLine":234}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151311-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151311/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151311-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151311,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This weakness reads a number and attempts to modify the two high bytes of it, if it is greater than 65535.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: UNION\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_50","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150626-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-06-ST02-DT07-DF14-CF15-01.xml"},"length":86235,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"7489c6eede9ac1aa59034cd26387ad6421161b0d5ce92d8ab48dd6b6abf954df"}},{"location":{"uri":"150626-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c"},"length":47052,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"c6a3ec2a38016740da3dc9d756ab0c4bc0045b6cf5c89d63f22371069020a787"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150626-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/error.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":358,"endLine":363}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150833-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150833/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150833-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150833,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case allocates a stack buffer of size 16.

The test case then creates an array of 3 pointers, setting each pointer to NULL initially. It checks each string read from the file, and if the length of the string from the file is non-zero, it sets the corresponding pointer to that string.

The test case then creates an array of 3 pointers, setting each pointer to NULL initially.

The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that we hit either a good or bad case, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon.

This allows input greater than 63 characters in length to over read the buffer, printing the contents of the memory located after the buffer on the heap. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_POINTER\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153300-v1.0.0/C-C126C-SUBV-07-ST03-DT04-DF17-CF18-01.xml"},"length":64232,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"3b27fa9b6882cb3786b227c17ec6a666667ae920b1a08a1c72f29c29608d8369"}},{"location":{"uri":"153300-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":50005,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"26e6d896075e5c111d209231b8b2d733e851fa45031a5e3fa9effe810ef8223b"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"126","name":"Buffer Over-read"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-126","message":{"text":"Buffer Over-read."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153300-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":913,"endLine":919}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"126","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152637-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152637/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152637-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152637,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_10","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152637-v1.0.0/C-C078B-SUBV-02-ST03-DT05-DF14-CF14-01.xml"},"length":63298,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"31b8f956b8a8cba9e2378264201f226e48992b08420bae74fecb27f71958ffd4"}},{"location":{"uri":"152637-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":11049,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"72933fb36ba033d23e5c27600f456a467420c3ed1dfe9e89e479e241af6b19a9"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"78","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-78","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152637-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":300,"endLine":308}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"78","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/153451-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/153451/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"153451-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":153451,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements an file read of 128 characters which does not properly null terminate the copied string if the original string is 128 characters in length or greater.

Since the message_data field is an int, rather than a char*, this causes a segmentation fault.    \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153652-v1.0.0/C-C843A-SUBV-02-ST04-DT04-DF14-CF03-01.xml"},"length":81831,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"ed4fb5d683bd3745026e35dec04e443c980e1f577892a2116622d8ced02043d3"}},{"location":{"uri":"153652-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"153652-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":9700,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"8133d41fc32cb5fdcc70bf5cd4b2281b0192d52cdc440ec5da8985aa2e6f4c32"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"843","name":"Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-843","message":{"text":"Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153652-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":211,"endLine":213}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"843","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151092-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151092/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151092-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151092,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: HEAP_POINTER\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_ARRAY_INDEX\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151092-v1.0.0/C-C191A-SUBV-07-ST01-DT04-DF16-CF20-01.xml"},"length":61167,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"286b6f0255dfcc21bec9cc45d4e93c4dbf6fba9e8af89a023e104159026336e5"}},{"location":{"uri":"151092-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":48477,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"9f6a1490e8304adf14d3fb135170c70d8cae4ea075e8ec5b20f27105aa22bcff"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"191","name":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-191","message":{"text":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151092-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":278,"endLine":284}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"191","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150612-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150612/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150612-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150612,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case implements a double checked lock around the initialization of a shared struct in an attempt to be efficient. The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that we hit either a good or bad case, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case spawns two threads which in turn attempt to get a shared instance of the input string by calling a double-checked locking function that initializes and/or returns a shared instance of a struct containing the input string. If one thread calls this function while the other one is inside the function initializing the struct it can return an uninitialized copy of the instance to the second thread.

The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing with exploiting input the test case spawns two threads, the first thread (thread A) starts by pausing its execution while the second thread (thread B) locks the second mutex lock. Thread B then pauses its execution and allows thread A to lock the first mutex lock and try to lock the second mutex lock. Thread A will now hang on the call to lock the second mutex lock since thread B holds it, thread B will then try to grab the first mutex lock, but since thread A holds it the system will enter deadlock. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_ALIAS_2\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_50","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150568-v1.0.0/C-C833A-SUBV-10-ST01-DT02-DF02-CF15-01.xml"},"length":75076,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"f8bd845926514dfc6909b08c5015edcb08d7e44a963e30a154282f8487dde085"}},{"location":{"uri":"150568-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":28386,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"f71a8c2a5a9bcbfdc28892a04487b4348fd6f2ef4e4473b30c921900c22276b0"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"833","name":"Deadlock"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-833","message":{"text":"Deadlock."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150568-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":219,"endLine":222}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"833","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150468-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150468/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150468-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150468,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"C programs have two main options for mutual exclusion of a shared resource in a concurrent setting: the mutex lock and the semaphore. Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150468-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-03-ST04-DT06-DF14-CF24-01.xml"},"length":100825,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"444fbc9c31480e8a7988a66b8d0bdec72daf3ec00ecbc793062d1a09a824044b"}},{"location":{"uri":"150468-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150468-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":51536,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"b8a4ed3c648a45a2eb151874e5daeb528faf119a725e5c8fe8872801177ed212"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150468-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":323,"endLine":328}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151866-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151866/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151866-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151866,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_LINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151866-v1.0.0/C-C775A-SUBV-01-ST03-DT06-DF13-CF03-01.xml"},"length":138406,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"c80cf1f779644b78b3a6e069d512d21287acefab877329df4fa18dac313f594d"}},{"location":{"uri":"151866-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c"},"length":70263,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"ed5a0b7a31b01cbd49ba11a229e962afa76dc91d9dc9c65a998d9a58d2e4aa84"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"775","name":"Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-775","message":{"text":"Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151866-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/dirent_uri.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":2074,"endLine":2086}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"775","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149839-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149839/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149839-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149839,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source.

Thread A will now hang on the call to lock the second mutex lock since thread B holds it, thread B will then try to grab the first mutex lock, but since thread A holds it the system will enter deadlock. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: POINTER_TO_FUNCTION","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150303-v1.0.0/C-C833A-SUBV-04-ST04-DT05-DF14-CF18-01.xml"},"length":92582,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"0f5d9c62a7b3c14285912e789185df964b7f39eef5b7b8aadc138a646f244a0b"}},{"location":{"uri":"150303-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150303-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/stream.c"},"length":61481,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"598455fc1c65b11bf7aaf3f9259080121f83003f72e1ed906a72b3521cd6240f"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"833","name":"Deadlock"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-833","message":{"text":"Deadlock."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150303-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/stream.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":238,"endLine":241}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"833","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150452-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150452/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150452-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150452,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"C programs have two main options for mutual exclusion of a shared resource in a concurrent setting: the mutex lock and the semaphore. Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_CONSTANT\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150452-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-07-ST01-DT01-DF05-CF24-01.xml"},"length":84239,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"c69556d1392abcc9251e9716df814bed7043dc53651cb46e5d9196337cc85ef7"}},{"location":{"uri":"150452-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":60420,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"11928b43659fe6dcbade47f3bb11f672167453c2b83634df9d223d0fe69803c6"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150452-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":285,"endLine":290}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/152705-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/152705/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"152705-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":152705,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: INDEX_ALIAS_10\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"152705-v1.0.0/C-C089D-SUBV-02-ST01-DT03-DF09-CF24-01.xml"},"length":71452,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"6b1d5239b9bca4448af53dff6e4081e0c3fa4354c062bdeccf776548708762a2"}},{"location":{"uri":"152705-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":9040,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"f7633fa653385d910f6f66844ac1358d0d9dbec06a4798ceaf96f8eb13e41b29"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"89","name":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-89","message":{"text":"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"152705-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":196,"endLine":204}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"89","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150798-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150798/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150798-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150798,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case converts a user string to a short, and then converts that short to an unsigned int.

This will overwrite memory on the stack, resulting in segmentation fault upon return from the function.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: BUFFER_ADDRESS_ARRAY_INDEX\n - Control Flow: INTERPROCEDURAL_2","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151374-v1.0.0/C-C191B-SUBV-08-ST01-DT05-DF16-CF13-01.xml"},"length":151507,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"9c2a6874b686e5f267c4dc497baeeb57f5013154eb6c25d025415158c110b861"}},{"location":{"uri":"151374-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c"},"length":36789,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"92bef7c7c68ee836cf3c94041a9688a20fe2618edd165df4b792e9189e0df3ab"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"191","name":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-191","message":{"text":"Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151374-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1047,"endLine":1051}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"191","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151987-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151987/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151987-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151987,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: STRUCT\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_NONLINEAR_EXPRESSION\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151987-v1.0.0/C-C774A-SUBV-07-ST01-DT05-DF14-CF24-01.xml"},"length":57701,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"823a2ba56e1a82208420c3fdc696d62e0f5f973eaec624883e60787954f6fb14"}},{"location":{"uri":"151987-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c"},"length":49653,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"f806c6e8e924b86aabf573dfd5d089f95af87ac5c02283724c52945f81491866"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"774","name":"Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-774","message":{"text":"Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without Limits or Throttling."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151987-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/config_file.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":138,"endLine":140}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"774","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150589-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150589/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150589-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150589,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case uses a counting semaphore initialized to one count of a shared resource to implement multiple unlocks of a critical resource for certain input. The test case takes a control integer, the names of two control files, and an input string. The control integer and the two control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case checks the input string for non-alpha characters, and if it contains non-alpha characters the test case increments the counting semaphore and spawns two threads that both use the semaphore as an access control mechanism surrounding a shared reference to the input string. Since the semaphore incorrectly indicates that there are two counts of the input string available, both threads now have the ability to access the shared string (actual concurrent access is controlled by the control files and integer) leading to a segfault. If the input string does not contain non-alpha characters, only one thread will spawn and the semaphore will be decremented and incremented appropriately, allowing the test case to run without error.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: BASIC\n - Control Flow: RECURSIVE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150589-v1.0.0/C-C765B-SUBV-10-ST04-DT02-DF11-CF19-01.xml"},"length":95852,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"1a71a2609317b9ae61de15c07bb3fd40e756d7162c660d07626904d8d5d9c37b"}},{"location":{"uri":"150589-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"150589-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":19233,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"b6b3967f33f80cd4609e27769fa94331dd1e8f8fed7cf6fb14fcdf97a540a094"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150589-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":199,"endLine":200}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151458-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151458/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151458-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151458,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"Metadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: VOID_POINTER\n - Data Flow: VAR_ARG_LIST\n - Control Flow: INFINITE_LOOP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151458-v1.0.0/C-C789A-SUBV-10-ST03-DT03-DF12-CF03-01.xml"},"length":68917,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"302b78b5ad0c0cc3aafffefa4818822be7e8c64166ad00ad8d4748c13a740bd1"}},{"location":{"uri":"151458-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c"},"length":14116,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"7b09ed0984268bd3c9211b7dabda77e9c11c517918edaea30d6cfe897460ae69"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"789","name":"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-789","message":{"text":"Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151458-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/types.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":404,"endLine":407}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"789","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149407-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149407/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149407-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149407,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source, and converts it to an integer, then an unsigned int.

It copies the taint source into the 1024-char buffer. It checks if the length of the taint source is less than the length of the 64-byte buffer. If it is, it uses strncpy to copy the taint source into the 64-byte buffer, with a maximum value of 1024 bytes. However, strncpy always writes the maximum number of bytes, and so writes 1024 bytes. This overflows the other data in the struct, including the pointer that originally pointed to the beginning of the 64-byte buffer. The test case then calls strlen on that pointer in the struct. However, since the pointer has been corrupted by the overflow, this causes a segmentation fault. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: SHARED_MEMORY\n - Data Type: UNION\n - Data Flow: INDEX_ALIAS_2\n - Control Flow: MACROS","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"153019-v1.0.0/C-C806C-SUBV-02-ST04-DT07-DF08-CF22-01.xml"},"length":81130,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"707e46b807b6f4fa04e057077b690edfb144d548c4495ee8dbdbf2f749631b64"}},{"location":{"uri":"153019-v1.0.0/scripts/shm_setup.c"},"length":3155,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"15d311b07d65d83f38876f4ee427c355e2048145d6db756d5d71877405f24822"}},{"location":{"uri":"153019-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c"},"length":9428,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"2269c74d9307d8784f9e0786626a5a3839ecfae0bb776fc4cc9a724b486b40fd"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"806","name":"Buffer Access Using Size of Source Buffer"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-806","message":{"text":"Buffer Access Using Size of Source Buffer."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"153019-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/mutex.c","index":2},"region":{"startLine":217,"endLine":221}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"806","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/151250-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/151250/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"151250-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":151250,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case takes an integer and mods it by four.

Because the unsigned value is huge, this overwrites the stack, resulting in a segmentation fault upon return from the function. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: SIMPLE\n - Data Flow: ADDRESS_AS_VARIABLE\n - Control Flow: CALLBACK","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"151264-v1.0.0/C-C195A-SUBV-05-ST01-DT02-DF15-CF01-01.xml"},"length":66511,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"d3cceaf621851a36106630109ad31ab49c34aec4a7b4056d8e430dc56c6d23f6"}},{"location":{"uri":"151264-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c"},"length":36600,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"0a06c2a2425dac0f5aed98d514951b9f2ec487e74cc5c34dc31ce722ce1c2284"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"195","name":"Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-195","message":{"text":"Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"151264-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":1115,"endLine":1119}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"195","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/149517-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/149517/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"149517-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":149517,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This test case reads the taint source.

Mutex locks exist in two states, locked and unlocked. However a semaphore, more specifically a counting semaphore, can be used to keep track of an arbitrary number of resources that are available at any given time, allowing access until all of the resources are being used. Using a counting semaphore, multiple unlocks will cause the semaphore to enter a bad state in which it indicates that there are more resources available than there actually are. This will then allow more threads to access the given resource than are allowed, leading to a bad state. This weakness variant uses a counting semaphore initialized to one unit of the shared resource. For inputs that contain a capital letter, a function is called that requests a resource, acts upon this resource, and releases the resource twice. This causes the semaphore to erroneously increment its number of units to two. Two threads are then spawned, both of which request the resource. The semaphore erroneously allows both to access the resource, and one thread gets a null pointer dereference. In the benign case, the semaphore allows only one thread to access the resource at a time, and the test case executes safely.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: INDEX_ALIAS_10\n - Control Flow: UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150313-v1.0.0/C-C765A-SUBV-03-ST01-DT01-DF09-CF24-01.xml"},"length":82586,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"51be240603f11d98b0625869b164040d11bc84cbc50684dfa462c7029101a207"}},{"location":{"uri":"150313-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c"},"length":50890,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"65bdbf94b3ed964ee9116a751996a0c2ceb8101c4a314b14e0f96fb94d880360"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"765","name":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-765","message":{"text":"Multiple Unlocks of a Critical Resource."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150313-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/utf.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":295,"endLine":300}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"765","index":0}]}]}]}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/150788-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/150788/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"150788-v1.0.0","sarif":{"version":"2.1.0","$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","runs":[{"properties":{"id":150788,"version":"1.0.0","type":"source code","status":"candidate","submissionDate":"2015-10-06","language":"c","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","description":"This weakness reads a number to be used as a loop counter.

The test case takes the names of two control files and an input string. The control files are used for timing within the test case to ensure that the test case follows an exploiting or benign execution path, and the input string is used as shared data for the threads to act upon. When executing, the test case assigns a signal hander to catch 'SIGURS1' that free()s an internal array, and if the input string starts with an 'A' assigns the same signal handler to catch 'SIGURS2'. If the test case receives both signals after registering the signal handler to both it will double free() the internal array causing a segfault. \nMetadata\n - Base program: Subversion\n - Source Taint: FILE_CONTENTS\n - Data Type: TYPEDEF\n - Data Flow: VAR_ARG_LIST\n - Control Flow: SEQUENCE","state":"bad","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:subversion:1.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","apache-subversion-v1.8.3"]},"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","version":"5.0.0","organization":"NIST","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"artifacts":[{"location":{"uri":"150370-v1.0.0/C-C831A-SUBV-05-ST02-DT06-DF12-CF20-01.xml"},"length":87773,"sourceLanguage":"xml","hashes":{"sha-256":"bd0fa5147f8c9511a48ae04f893b47ae036cf03f1fa6c1f9126347fcb3aa704b"}},{"location":{"uri":"150370-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c"},"length":42306,"sourceLanguage":"c","hashes":{"sha-256":"14f542d272fa50089ccc6e4afcf589dadb359db929f8e9e8a078538d3c39452d"}}],"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","version":"4.6","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"},"isComprehensive":false,"taxa":[{"id":"831","name":"Signal Handler Function Associated with Multiple Signals"}]}],"results":[{"ruleId":"CWE-831","message":{"text":"Signal Handler Function Associated with Multiple Signals."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"artifactLocation":{"uri":"150370-v1.0.0/src/subversion/libsvn_subr/string.c","index":1},"region":{"startLine":196,"endLine":200}}}],"taxa":[{"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0},"id":"831","index":0}]}]}]}}]}
