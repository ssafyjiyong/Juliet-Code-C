          value: This is probably going to overflow a buffer of some sort.  Let's run it anyway and see what happens.  I hope that everything turns out ok, because I would love to see what this looks like in all CAPS.  Converting ASCII characters to upper case is easy, you can either call a system function, or just add the standard difference between the start of the two character sets.  But, I am sure there is a reason that system functions exist for this sort of functionality.
